# Unicross
Unicross is a simple 180mm cross-gantry 3d printer. It was designed to fill a niche - that being cheap cross gantry printers. The BOM cost is about $400, making this printer a good replacement for a Prusa Mini or other similar machine.

There is no assembly guide, because I made this machine primarily for myself, but there are attached STEP files for the toolhead and main assembly to reference off of. A BOM is completed.

The BOM totals to about $420 using the parts I used, but I also picked some fairly high quality parts. This build can be much cheaper - below $400 - if you so desire.
