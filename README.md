# Unicross
Unicross is a simple 180mm cross-gantry 3d printer. It was designed to fill a niche - that being cheap cross gantry printers. The BOM cost was about $400 as of 2024, making this printer a good replacement for a Prusa Mini or other similar machine. 

Version 2 is the current usable version. Version 1 is deprecated.

There is no assembly guide, because I made this machine primarily for myself, but there are attached STEP files for the toolhead and main assembly to reference off of. A BOM is completed. I recommend you open the toolhead and assembly STEP files in your favorite CAD software and use the built-in tools to explore the model during assembly.

When I built this machine it cost about $400-450. However, the fluctuating prices of goods during the current trade crisis means I cannot provide an estimate of cost. Proceed with caution.
